# Weather-App
This weather app displays current API data for the city that was searched. The temperature can be changed from Farenheit to Celsius and vice versa. I used webpack to bundle the files.

I developed functions that use the OpenWeather GeoCode API to get the Latitude and Longitude of the searched location and then the Lat and Lon data is pushed into the OpenWeather API that fetches the forecast for that locations current weather.
